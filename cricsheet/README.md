the directory `../odis` is created by unzipping `odis.zip`

* Column 3: # of balls that resulted in 1 runs
* Column 4: # of balls that resulted in 2 runs
* Column 5: # of balls that resulted in 3 runs
* Column 6: # of balls that resulted in 4 runs
* Column 7: # of balls that resulted in 5 runs
* Column 8: # of balls that resulted in 6 runs
* Column 9: # of balls that resulted in 7 runs. There are many balls in the dataset that result
  in 7 runs due to batsman hitting a six and it being a no ball e.g.
* Column 10: # of valid balls bowled
* Column 11: # of no-balls and wides (these need to be bowled again)
* Column 12: # of wickets (outs)

# To calculate the average probability

```
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> data = pd.read_csv('odi_prob.txt', sep=" ", header=None)
>>> M=data.mean(axis=0,skipna=True,numeric_only=True)
>>> M

```

verify sum of probabilities equals to 1:
```
>>> M[0:9].sum()
0.9999961989342812
```

these probabilities are used as input to the simulation model

# Calculating probability of tie

This data can be used to construct a histogram of runs by [histogram.py](../histogram.py)

![Histogram](odi_hist.png "Histogram of Runs in ODI")

A Gaussian fit gives mu=227, sigma=68. From this, we can calculate probability of a tie as

```
>>> import math
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from scipy.stats import lognorm, norm
>>> import scipy.integrate as integrate
>>> f = lambda x: norm.pdf(x,227,68)
>>> c = lambda x: f(x) * f(x)
>>> integrate.quad(c, 0, float("inf"))
(0.004148447951709275, 4.359805441782799e-11)
```
